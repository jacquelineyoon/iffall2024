                    <h3>Recipe Page</h3>
                    <p>This is the Recipe Page I created for Interaction Foundations in October 2024. The recipe is for Spaghetti al Pomodoro using an authentic recipe from La Cucina Italiana. My focus for this page was to create a responsive website that users can easily follow to make this dish. I based most of my color and font choices off materials I have observed from various Italian restaurants.</p>

                    <h3>Microsite - Designer/Developer</h3>
                    <p>This is the Microsite I created for Interaction Foundations in December of 2024. Producing the vision of my creative director, Nicole Farnsley, I developed this site based on Charli XCX and her new album "Brat." Using the album cover as inspiration for the design elements, I created a one-page site that goes through the album's background, marketing, songs, and more. </p>

                    <h3>Microsite - Creative Director</h3>
                    <p>This is the Microsite that was created under my creative direction for Interaction Foundations in December of 2024. The theme of the site is "The Nutcracker," a famous ballet primarily shown around Christmas. It explores the show's history, plot, music, and more. I wanted this site to be informational and appeal to a wide variety of audiences. It was developed by Ellie Kosowsky.</p>
