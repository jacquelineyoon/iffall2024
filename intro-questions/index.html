        <h1>Intro Questions</h1>
       
        <p>1. My name is Jackie and I am a senior double majoring in Statistics and Communication Design with a minor in Anthropology.</p>

        <p>2. I am interested in web design and wanted to learn how to use HTML and CSS, but also as a Communication Design second major it is part of my course requirements.</p>

        <p>3. I don't have any experience!</p>

        <p>4. I am looking forward to learning how to use these different platforms to create real websites/web pages.</p>

        <p>5. When designing for the screen you have to keep in mind that it can be seen across a variety of different platforms and technologies. The designs have to be more flexible to adjust to the differences.</p>

        <p>6. <a href="https://www.aritzia.com/us/en/home" target="_blank">Aritzia's Website</a> is effective in its design because it is representative of their clean and modern style of clothing. There is a strong mix of images, videos, and text that displays and advertises their clothing and brand well.</p>

        <p>7. <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" target="_blank">Airbnb's Website</a> shows effective communication because it easily shows what the company does and what their product is. Furthermore, the clear layout and use of other elements like iconography makes the site easy to navigate for the user.</p>

        <p>8. <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/" target="_blank">Pinterest's Website</a> is an example of a site that works well. It serves as a platform that has many functions, from sharing ideas to social media to shopping. The design of the website allows users to easily use their account to perform a variety of these actions.</p>
